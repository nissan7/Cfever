this python program is for sending update of live (or latest) cricket score(IPL) as text sms on any mobile number (continuous after a fix interval).  
In order to use it---->  
1.Go to [way2sms](http://site24.way2sms.com/content/index.html)  
2.Sign up  
3.Run this program (terminal---> python cfever.py)

TODO--->  
1.making specific terminal command to use it (like- if we type "send livescore", program should run automatically)  

Any other contribution would be appreciated.  

##Happy Coding##
